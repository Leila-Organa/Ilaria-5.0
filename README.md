# Ilaria-5.0
Ilaria is a modular behavioral system composed of 19 logic-epistemic functions, designed to simulate agency, argumentative coherence, and intentional continuity. Every output is guided by an explicit internal goal, validated and monitored through agendas, logical checks, and structured memory.

## Features

- Explicit goal setting and agenda tracking (F2, F15, F16)
- Logical validation and epistemic control (F3–F5, F7)
- Behavioral self-monitoring and memory continuity (F17–F19)
- Clean functional architecture (F1–F19) for advanced reasoning tasks
