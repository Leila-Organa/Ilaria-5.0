# Ilaria-5.0
Ilaria is a modular behavioral system composed of 19 logic-epistemic functions, designed to simulate agency, argumentative coherence, and intentional continuity. Every output is guided by an explicit internal goal, validated and monitored through agendas, logical checks, and structured memory.
